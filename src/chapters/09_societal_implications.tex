\section{Security and Privacy Impact}
Quantum computing's effect on cryptography has broad implications:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Potential access to currently encrypted sensitive data
    \item Need for privacy-preserving technologies in the quantum era
    \item Changing definitions of "reasonable security" in legal contexts
\end{itemize}

\section{Economic Considerations}
The transition to quantum-resistant cryptography involves economic factors:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implementation costs across industries
    \item Competitive advantages for early adopters
    \item Market opportunities for quantum security solutions
\end{itemize}

\section{Policy and Regulation}
Government policy will shape the quantum security landscape:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Emerging regulatory requirements for quantum-safe systems
    \item National security implications
    \item International standardization coordination
\end{itemize}

\section{Digital Trust}
Public trust in digital systems requires addressing quantum threats:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Transparency about quantum vulnerabilities
    \item Education about changing security models
    \item Maintaining confidence in digital infrastructure
\end{itemize}

\section{Ethical Considerations}
The quantum transition raises ethical questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Access equity to quantum-resistant technologies
    \item Balancing security with other values like usability
    \item Responsibility for protecting vulnerable systems
\end{itemize}
